# ðŸ“Š Linear Regression with Gradient Descent and mean square error

This repository contains implementations of **Linear Regression** using two optimization techniques:

- **Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Updates weights using the whole dataset per iteration.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Updates weights using one data point at a time.
- **Mean Squared Error**: Evaluates the accuracy of predictions by computing average squared difference.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

Three separate `.csv` files are included in this repository, each corresponding to:

- data1-StochiasticGD.ipynb â†’ data_1.csv
- linear-regression-data-Batch.ipynb â†’ data.csv
- odd-BatchGD.ipynb â†’ odd.csv

Make sure the respective file is in the same directory as the script when running.
